/**
 * The `own_wording` rule — the app writing out the SOURCE's own words instead of citing them.
 *
 * Separate from the other guard suites because it catches a different failure. `bad_hadith` and
 * `bad_ref` ask whether a claim carries a RECEIPT. This rule asks what the app WROTE: an answer can
 * carry a perfectly resolving marker and a real ayah number and still print the app's own Indonesian
 * rendering of the verse or the hadith beside the official one. Both prohibitions existed only in
 * SYNTHESIS_SYSTEM_PROMPT until now, and a prompt rule is a request — measured on prod 2026-08-17,
 * 3 violations across 7 live answers with the rules deployed.
 *
 * THE THRESHOLD IS SET FROM A MEASURED DISTRIBUTION, NOT FROM TASTE. Every quoted span in those 7
 * answers, by word count: 18 and 12 (hadith wording, verbatim), 11 (QS 2:187's wording), 6 (the
 * reader's own imagined voice — benign), then 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1 (bare terms — benign). The violations
 * and the benign quotes separate at 8 words with two words of margin under it, and the 6-word case
 * is pinned below as a regression test rather than left to luck.
